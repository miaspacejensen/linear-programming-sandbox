    "\n",
    "Linear programming (LP) is an optimisation technique used in data science and operations research to solve problems where the goal is to maximise or minimise a linear objective function subject to a set of linear constraints. These constraints represent limitations or restrictions on certain resources or conditions."

    "#### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective function**: The linear function to be optimised (either maximised or minimised).\n",
    "- **Decision variables**: The unknowns that we need to solve for in the LP problem. These represent quantities to determine, like how much of a resource to use or allocate.\n",
    "- **Constraints**: Linear equations or inequalities that restrict the possible values of the decision variables.\n",
    "- **Feasible region**: The set of values that satisfy all constraints. It is often visualised as a convex polygon in two dimensions (or a polyhedron in higher dimensions).\n",
    "- **Non-negativity restriction**: The variables are often restricted to be non-negative because negative values may not have real-world meaning (e.g., negative production or resource allocation)."

    "#### Possible applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resource allocation**: Optimise how resources like time, money, or personnel are distributed, such as assigning tasks in workforce scheduling or optimizing supply chain operations.\n",
    "- **Predictive modeling**: LP can assist in models such as least absolute deviations regression, where you minimise the sum of absolute prediction errors.\n",
    "- **Portfolio optimisation**: In finance, LP helps determine how to allocate investments to maximise returns or minimise risk while adhering to various constraints.\n",
    "- **Blending problems**: Combine different raw materials (e.g., in manufacturing or food production) to minimise production costs while meeting quality standards.\n",
    "- **Game theory and decision making**: LP can help solve strategic decision-making problems in competitive environments.\n"
